    "summary": "As computer memory becomes abundant, it is now possible to load large data sets in main memory for fast analysis, without the input/output overhead of secondary storage or the complexity of distributed computing. But with data size close to your computer memory capacity (~ 1-100 GB), you need an in-memory database system that is memory-safe and computationally efficient. For iterative or reproducible analysis, you also need storage-efficient version control of your data sets. Here I present a hierarchical data schema for version control of massive data sets, and R code for creating and validating data at the various processing levels, exemplified by over 100 GB of NYC taxi trip records. The hierarchical schema, inspired by remote sensing practices, represents data at levels from 0 to 4: 0, raw data; 1, syntactically correct data; 2, semantically correct data with derived variables; 3, data with regular spatial and temporal organization; 4, aggregated or model output. I compare popular in-memory columnar databases in R, `data.table` and “tidyverse” (`tibble`), and serialization libraries, `fst` and Apache Arrow (`feather`), and give my recommendations.",

    "summary": "Urban transportation is undergoing rapid changes, facing challenges from technology-enabled private mobility services. Managing the existing modes of transportation along with emerging modes affects traffic congestion and thus the economic efficiency of a city. Effective regulation of public and private transportation services needs to consider the spatiotemporal characteristics of their operation. Here we study the competitive advantages of early stage Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) over city-regulated taxis. With competition from TNCs, taxi trips are expected to decline over time, and a null hypothesis is that the decline was homogeneous in space and across time of day. However, using trip records of taxis and TNCs between 2011 and 2015 in New York City (NYC), we observe that between 2011 and 2013, taxis were subject to a statistically significant and invariant decline in trip share during daytime (8 am - 4 pm), negligible change in early evening (6 pm - 10 pm) which are the peak hours for taxi trips, and linearly increasing share declines into late night (11 pm - 3 am), while absolute decline was lesser for late Friday nights. Spatially, the decline was statistically significant except for taxi hot spots, and the decline in outer boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx) were much larger than in city center (Manhattan). Such patterns in space and time became diminished in 2014 and 2015. We explain these observations within the framework of competitive advantage. Before gaining significant market share, early competitors first establish themselves where they have competitive advantage that does not depend on capital. In the case of ride-sourcing against curbside ride-hailing service, waiting time, convenience, as well as safety are most pronounced at late night, because fewer taxis and people are on the streets while the cost of ride-sourcing has almost no change. As the competitor gains capital and thus further reduces fare and time cost, the initial competitive advantage no longer stands out. Our work reveals the strengths and weaknesses of traditional and emerging modes of transportation, informs urban governance that is optimal for traffic management, and is also useful for location choices of new entrant firms.",

    "summary": "I use three equilibrium concepts in the sciences to study the dynamics of taxi transportation. At the microscopic level, I formalized taxi drivers' decision-making as an income-maximizing optimization, which collectively establishes an economic equilibrium. I solved the game theoretic equilibrium of multi-market oligopoly, which includes the taxi industry as a special case. For a macroscopic interpretation of the equilibrium outcome, I use thermodynamic equilibrium where aggregate behavior is perceived as transport phenomenon built up from individual choices. This work thus provides a microeconomic origin of urban-scale dynamics, harmonizing social and physical sciences.",

    "summary": "I use in-vehicle Global Positioning System (GPS) data to estimate the supply and demand of street-hail taxis at segment level of a road network, without surveilling the population. To this end, I model taxi demand and supply as non-stationary Poisson random fields on the road network, and pickups result from taxis searching for impatient passengers on street segments. Relating this model with queueing theory gives pickup rate, and modeling driver income maximization as a symmetric game gives equilibrium supply rate. With 868 million trip records of all 13,237 licensed taxis in New York City from 2009 to 2013—while it was still a monopoly market—I match GPS locations to street segments for pickup and supply, and demand is estimated by solving nonlinear equations. I validate that taxi pickups can be modeled as Poisson processes, and that demand estimates are stable at different supply levels and across years. Our method is thus simple, feasible, and reliable in estimating street-hail taxi activities at high spatial resolution. Contrary to common impression, in high-demand locations street-hail taxis out-perform transportation network companies (TNC) such as Uber, suggesting a taxi/TNC regulation change to reduce congestion and pollution.",

We review the issue of uncertainty in integrated assessment modeling, focusing on the techniques of uncertainty characterization. We propose applying manifold sampling, a machine learning technique, to characterize uncertainty in impact assessment, which constructs a joint probability model that helps answer three types of policy-making questions: (1) prediction; (2) response; and (3) prevention.
