    "summary": "Subspace-constrained Mean Shift (SCMS) is an iterative algorithm for non-parametric ridge estimation. Although SCMS is computationally feasible, it is only linearly convergent and its computational complexity per iteration is quadratic in sample size and cubic in data dimension. Here I propose Subspace-constrained Accelerated Mean Shift (SAMS), two accelerated variants of SCMS. The first (SAMS1) is also linearly convergent, but its computational complexity per iteration is linear in both sample size and data dimension. The second (SAMS2) is quadratically convergent, and its computational complexity per iteration is linear in sample size and quadratic in data dimension. Such speed-ups are achieved by using local density kernels, partial eigen-decomposition, and Newton-type root-finding methods. I provide an error bound of local estimate of the mean shift vector, and provide selection rules for neighbor size and kernel bandwidth. I also prove the convergence of SAMS update sequences. ",

    "summary": "For probability density estimation on Riemannian manifolds, many methods have been proposed, parametric or non-parametric. However, whether they can be implemented for general manifolds is in question. Here we propose a kernel-based method for density estimation and sampling of singular measures supported on Riemannian submanifolds. Based on the theory of Pelletier (2005), the kernels are functions of the Riemannian geodesic distance on the submanifold, which we estimate from a neighborhood graph of data. To improve the estimate of geodesic distances, we densify the graph by numerical retraction. With an estimated kernel bandwidth, we can sample from the model using the same retraction. Our method applies to both constraint manifolds and data manifolds, and is more efficient compared with diffusion-based methods and eigenfunction projection.",

    "summary": "Efficient approximation of geodesics is crucial for practical algorithms on manifolds. Here we introduce a class of retractions on submanifolds, induced by a foliation of the ambient manifold. They match the projective retraction to the third order and thus match the exponential map to the second order. In particular, we show that Newton retraction (NR) is always stabler than the popular approach known as oblique projection or orthographic retraction: per Kantorovich-type convergence theorems, the superlinear convergence regions of NR include those of the latter. We also show that NR always has a lower computational cost. The preferable properties of NR are useful for optimization, sampling, and many other statistical problems on manifolds.",

    "summary": "Probabilistic models of data sets often exhibit salient geometric structure. Such a phenomenon is summed up in the manifold distribution hypothesis, and can be exploited in probabilistic learning. Here we present normal-bundle bootstrap (NBB), a method that generates new data which preserve the geometric structure of a given data set. Inspired by algorithms for manifold learning and concepts in differential geometry, our method decomposes the underlying probability measure into a marginalized measure on a learned data manifold and conditional measures on the normal spaces. The algorithm estimates the data manifold as a density ridge, and constructs new data by bootstrapping projection vectors and adding them to the ridge. We apply our method to the inference of density ridge and related statistics, and data augmentation to reduce overfitting.",

At the microscopic level, I formalized taxi drivers' decision-making as an income-maximizing optimization, which collectively establishes an economic equilibrium. I solved the game theoretic equilibrium of multi-market oligopoly, which includes the taxi industry as a special case. For a macroscopic interpretation of the equilibrium outcome, I use thermodynamic equilibrium where aggregate behavior is perceived as transport phenomenon built up from individual choices. This work thus provides a microeconomic origin of urban-scale dynamics, harmonizing social and physical sciences.",

    "summary": "I use in-vehicle Global Positioning System (GPS) data to estimate the supply and demand of street-hail taxis at segment level of a road network, without surveilling the population. To this end, I model taxi demand and supply as non-stationary Poisson random fields on the road network, and pickups result from taxis searching for impatient passengers on street segments. Relating this model with queueing theory gives pickup rate, and modeling driver income maximization as a symmetric game gives equilibrium supply rate. With 868 million trip records of all 13,237 licensed taxis in New York City from 2009 to 2013—while it was still a monopoly market—I match GPS locations to street segments for pickup and supply, and demand is estimated by solving nonlinear equations. I validate that taxi pickups can be modeled as Poisson processes, and that demand estimates are stable at different supply levels and across years. Our method is thus simple, feasible, and reliable in estimating street-hail taxi activities at high spatial resolution. Contrary to common impression, in high-demand locations street-hail taxis out-perform transportation network companies (TNC) such as Uber, suggesting a taxi/TNC regulation change to reduce congestion and pollution.",
